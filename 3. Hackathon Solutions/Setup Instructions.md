1. Set your desired database and cloud storage variables in ./_resources/00_configuration 
2. Run ./_resources/01_setup *NOTE: IF RUNNING WITH RESET_ALL = true, THE DATABASE WILL BE CLEARED*
3. If you'd like to make changes to the data that is generated, alter the appropriate code in ./_resources/02_data_generator
